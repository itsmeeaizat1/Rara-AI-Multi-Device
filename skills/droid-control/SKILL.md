# Droid Control

Automate terminals, browsers, and desktop apps. Route by the user's requested method first, then load only the mechanics and evidence stages needed.

## Ground rules

1. **Real apps, real environments.** Non-deterministic behavior (LLM responses, network latency, variable output) is expected. Handle it with `wait` / `wait-idle`. Never substitute fixtures or mocked data.
2. **Recover from evidence.** After a failed or uncertain action, observe current state before retrying. Honor method constraints and permission boundaries; a refusal does not authorize another driver or broader target.
3. **Atoms include their references.** Load linked material on demand. Desktop-use does not require a separately installed cua skill.
4. **`tctl` owns recorded terminal sessions.** It wraps `asciinema rec` around the PTY; browser and desktop drivers own their separate lifecycles. Never call `tuistory launch` directly. Resolve `TCTL` to an absolute path only for terminal workflows or worker handoffs.
5. **Isolate every run.** Multiple droids may be filming simultaneously on the same machine. Session names and output paths share a global namespace (`/tmp/tctl-sessions/`). At the start of every workflow, generate a run ID (`RUN_ID=$(date +%s)-$$` or similar) and use it as a prefix for all session names and a scoped temp directory for all output files:
   ```bash
   RUN_ID="$(date +%s)-$$"
   RUN_DIR="$(mktemp -d /tmp/droid-run-${RUN_ID}-XXXXXX)"
   # Session names: -s ${RUN_ID}-before, -s ${RUN_ID}-after
   # Output paths: ${RUN_DIR}/before.cast, ${RUN_DIR}/after.cast
   ```
   Never use bare session names like `-s demo`, `-s before`, `-s after` — they will collide with concurrent runs.
   Separate names and paths do not isolate shared desktop focus or keyboard input. Keep one controller for a visible desktop.

## Routing

Three independent lookups. Do all three, then load the union of skills they produce.

### 1. Target route — what are you driving?

| Target | Load these skills |
|---|---|
| User explicitly requests cua-only, native GUI input, or desktop control (including Electron) | **desktop-use**; method constraints override the defaults below |
| Droid CLI (`droid-dev`, `droid exec`) | **terminal-use** + **droid-cli** |
| Other terminal TUI | **terminal-use** |
| Web page or Electron app | **browser-use** |
| Native desktop GUI app | **desktop-use** |
| Raw terminal byte sequences | **terminal-use** + **pty-capture** |

**terminal-use** selects the terminal backend behind `${DROID_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/tctl`: `tuistory` by default, and it loads **true-input** when real terminal rendering or keyboard-encoding evidence is needed. Desktop-use includes compositor-specific guidance; inspect live Cua capabilities rather than assuming all Linux targets are X11-only or abandoning the user's chosen method.

### 2. Stage route — what does the workflow need?

Every workflow passes through stages. Load the atoms for each stage you'll use.

| Stage | Skill | When to load |
|---|---|---|
| Capture | **capture** | Recording, scripted multi-step evidence, or a demo/QA deliverable; ordinary desktop operation uses the driver's observe/verify loop |
| Compose | **compose** | When the deliverable is a produced artifact (video, annotated screenshots, comparison image) |
| Verify | **verify** | Formal proof, demo, or QA deliverable; every action still needs verification even without this stage |

### 3. Artifact route — does compose need polish tools?

Only relevant when **compose** is loaded.

| Artifact need | Also load |
|---|---|
| Showcase polish (window chrome, branded frame, cinematic background) | **showcase** |
| Effects and keystroke overlays | (compose handles this — they're fields in the Remotion props JSON) |

## Workflow shape

```
Command (intent + commitments)
  → Target route (load driver atoms)
  → Capture (record / screenshot / byte-capture)
  → Compose (assemble deliverable, if needed)
  → Verify (check against commitments)
  → Report
```

Commands declare **what** to produce. Atoms own **how**.

### Layout default

**Default: `single`.** One clip showing the target/final state. Pick this unless the deliverable is fundamentally a comparison.

| Case | Layout |
|---|---|
| Brand-new feature (no meaningful prior state) | `single` |
| Bug fix, single-clip proof of the working path | `single` |
| Walkthrough / tutorial / readme hero | `single` |
| Regression proof (broken vs fixed) | `side-by-side` |
| Behavior-preserving refactor (visual parity is the point) | `side-by-side` |
| User explicitly asks for a comparison | `side-by-side` |

Do not synthesize a "before" state to justify `side-by-side`. If there is no real baseline, use `single`.

## Delegation

Keep short interactive desktop tasks in the parent: it owns observations, input, user permission waits, and cleanup. Delegate independent capture environments or rendering, not individual screenshots interleaved with another controller's input.

### What to delegate

| Task | Delegate? | Why |
|---|---|---|
| **Interactive shared desktop** | NO — parent | One controller owns focus, snapshots, input, permission waits, and cleanup |
| **Capture clip in an isolated terminal/browser environment** | YES | Worker owns the complete interaction and recording lifecycle |
| **Capture both clips** (comparison layout) | YES, only with independent environments | Worktrees and session labels alone do not isolate a desktop |
| **Remotion render** | YES | Needs only props JSON, clip paths, output path. Runs `render-showcase.sh` (handles .cast conversion, per-render staging, fidelity profiles, longest-clip duration, cleanup) |
| Planning, interaction scripting | NO — parent | Requires PR context and editorial judgment |
| Layout and prop construction | NO — parent | Requires editorial decisions about effects, timing, labels |
| Verification | NO — parent | Requires commitment context |
| Single ffprobe / file-existence check | NO — inline | Too trivial for subagent overhead |

### How to delegate

**Step 0: Resolve paths and generate a run ID.** Workers don't inherit `${DROID_PLUGIN_ROOT}`. Resolve once, paste everywhere:

```bash
TCTL="$(realpath "${DROID_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/tctl")"
RENDER="$(realpath "${DROID_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/render-showcase.sh")"
RUN_ID="$(date +%s)-$$"
RUN_DIR="$(mktemp -d /tmp/droid-run-${RUN_ID}-XXXXXX)"
```

Use `${RUN_DIR}` for all output files (recordings, props, rendered video). Use `${RUN_ID}-` as a prefix for all session names. Never use bare names like `-s before` or hardcoded paths like `/tmp/before.cast`.

Give workers **exact commands** with the resolved absolute paths — not abstract instructions, not `tuistory`, not `${DROID_PLUGIN_ROOT}`. The parent does the thinking; the worker executes:

```
Task prompt for a capture worker:
  "Run these commands in order. Report the output file path and any errors.
   1. /abs/path/to/bin/tctl launch "droid-dev" -s 1712345678-42-before --backend tuistory \
        --repo-root /abs/path/to/baseline/worktree \
        --cols 120 --rows 36 --record /tmp/droid-run-1712345678-42-xxxx/before.cast \
        --env FORCE_COLOR=3 --env COLORTERM=truecolor
   2. /abs/path/to/bin/tctl -s 1712345678-42-before wait ">" --timeout 15000
   3. /abs/path/to/bin/tctl -s 1712345678-42-before type "hello world"
   4. /abs/path/to/bin/tctl -s 1712345678-42-before press enter
   5. /abs/path/to/bin/tctl -s 1712345678-42-before wait-idle
   6. /abs/path/to/bin/tctl -s 1712345678-42-before close"
```

```
Task prompt for a Remotion render worker:
  "Run this command. Report the output file path and any errors.
   /abs/path/to/scripts/render-showcase.sh \
     --props /tmp/droid-run-1712345678-42-xxxx/showcase-props.json \
     --output /tmp/droid-run-1712345678-42-xxxx/demo.mp4 \
     /tmp/droid-run-1712345678-42-xxxx/before.cast /tmp/droid-run-1712345678-42-xxxx/after.cast"
```

### Parallel capture pattern (comparison flows only)

Only applicable when the Layout default table selects `side-by-side` and the capture environments are independent. Serialize shared-desktop captures. For a single interactive desktop task, keep control in the parent.

For before/after comparison demos, launch both capture workers simultaneously:

```
1. Parent constructs the interaction script (identical for both branches)
2. Launch worker A: capture the baseline/reference branch with `--repo-root` set to that worktree
3. Launch worker B: capture the candidate/change branch with `--repo-root` set to that worktree
4. Wait for both to complete (TaskOutput)
5. Collect .cast paths from results
6. Continue to compose
```

## Shared tooling

Terminal drivers use the unified `tctl` wrapper. Browser-use and desktop-use have their own CLIs (`agent-browser`, `cua-driver`) and do not use `tctl`.

Drivers can be combined in one workflow — e.g., `tctl` for a CLI and `agent-browser` for a web UI it interacts with.

## Degraded-tail repro recipe (droid TUI)

Deterministic recipe for reproducing degraded transcript tails in the droid CLI — stranded live tool rows and queued steering messages — without waiting for a slow model turn. The trick: a slow `PreToolUse` hook pins a tool in its executing state for as long as you need.

1. **Scratch project.** Create a throwaway directory (never a real repo — the hook fires on every matching tool call) with a project-local hook that sleeps:

   ```bash
   SCRATCH="$(mktemp -d /tmp/degraded-tail-XXXXXX)"
   mkdir -p "$SCRATCH/.factory"
   cat > "$SCRATCH/.factory/settings.json" <<'JSON'
   {
     "hooks": {
       "PreToolUse": [
         {
           "matcher": "TodoWrite",
           "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "sleep 120" }]
         }
       ]
     }
   }
   JSON
   ```

   Pick a sleep long enough to interact mid-hook (60–180s) and a matcher for a tool the prompt will reliably trigger (`TodoWrite` fires on any multi-step ask).

2. **Launch with `--cwd` pointed at the scratch project** — `--repo-root` stays on your dev worktree so `droid-dev` provenance still records the code under test:

   ```bash
   $TCTL launch "droid-dev" -s ${RUN_ID}-tail --cwd "$SCRATCH" \
     --repo-root /abs/path/to/dev/worktree --record ${RUN_DIR}/tail.cast
   ```

3. **Trigger the hook**, then degrade the tail while the tool row shows executing:
   - **Interrupt mid-hook** (`press escape`) — strands the live tool row: it never resolves to a completed/canceled state in the transcript tail.
   - **Steer mid-hook** (`type "..."` + `press enter`) — the steering message queues behind the executing tool instead of interleaving.

**Gotcha:** dev-scope hook settings can silently disable project hooks. If the tool completes instantly, run `/hooks` in the session and check the "Hooks enabled" toggle before debugging the hook config itself.
